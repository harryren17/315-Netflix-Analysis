# 315-Netflix-Analysis
This Repo contains the code for my 36-315: Statistical Graphics & Visualizations course that I took in the spring of my sophomore year at CMU.
The task was to select any data set and generate and analyze three meaningful research questions with a focus on data visualization.
This project won the intraclass "coolest visuals" competition.

This project was made with Rachel Dolle, Ziyan Wang, and Rose Lee.
